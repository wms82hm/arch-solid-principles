# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Concept

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

### Benefits

Easier to Test: Classes with a single responsibility are simpler to understand and test.
Reduced Complexity: Limits the impact of changes, as each class is only focused on one task.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

### Concept

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing the existing code.

### Benefits

Scalability: Facilitates the addition of new features without modifying existing code.
Stability: Reduces the risk of breaking existing functionality.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

### Concept

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

### Benefits

Interchangeability: Ensures that subclasses can stand in for their parent classes.
Robust Design: Promotes the correctness of inheritance hierarchies.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

### Concept

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle suggests splitting large interfaces into smaller ones.

### Benefits

Flexibility: Clients only need to know about the methods that are of interest to them.
Maintainability: Easier to make changes as changes in one part of the system are less likely to affect other parts.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Concept

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions.

### Benefits

Decoupling: Reduces the dependency between different parts of the code.
Flexibility: Easier to refactor, change, and deploy.
